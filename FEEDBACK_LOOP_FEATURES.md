```

### **Step 2: Summary Generation**
The system creates a detailed summary email like:
```
📧 Gmail Automation Summary - 2025-07-28 - 15 emails processed

📊 PROCESSING SUMMARY
- Total emails processed: 15
- Emails categorized and organized: 15
- Draft responses created: 3  
- Emails cleaned up/deleted: 5
- All emails marked as read: ✅

📋 DETAILED BREAKDOWN
Categories Processed:
- IMPORTANT: 4 emails (3 High, 1 Medium)

🔄 FEEDBACK REQUEST:
