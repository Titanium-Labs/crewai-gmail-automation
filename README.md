## 🔐 OAuth2 Setup

This application uses OAuth2 for secure Gmail authentication. Follow the [OAuth2 Setup Guide](OAUTH2_SETUP.md) to configure Google Cloud credentials and enable multi-user support.

## 🔍 Usage

### Streamlit Web Interface (Recommended)

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

This will open a web interface where you can:
- Authenticate multiple Gmail accounts via OAuth2
- Manage user sessions  
- Process emails with AI
- View processing results

### Command Line

For OAuth2 mode:
```bash
# Set the current user ID
export CURRENT_USER_ID=your_user_id

# Run the crew
crewai run
```

You'll be prompted to enter the number of emails to process (default is 5).

The application will:
1. 📥 Fetch your unread emails via OAuth2
2. 🔎 Categorize them by type and priority
3. ⭐ Apply appropriate labels and stars
4. ✏️ Generate draft responses for important emails
5. 🗑️ Clean up low-priority emails based on age
6. 🧹 Empty the trash to free up storage space

## 🌟 Special Features

- **📅 Smart Deletion Rules**: 
  - Promotions older than 2 days are automatically deleted
  - Newsletters older than 7 days (unless HIGH priority) are deleted
  - Shutterfly emails are always deleted regardless of age
  - Receipts and important documents are archived instead of deleted

- **🎬 YouTube Protection**: All YouTube-related emails are preserved and marked as READ_ONLY (you'll respond directly on YouTube)

- **✍️ Smart Response Generation**: Responses are tailored to the email context and include proper formatting

- **🧵 Thread Handling**: Properly tracks and manages email threads to maintain conversation context
